This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev -- This runs the server
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

-   FormData with API endpoints...

*   Much cleaner to append and access different key, val pairs within the formData sent through the req.body.
