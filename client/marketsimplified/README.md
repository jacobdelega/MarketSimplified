This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev -- This runs the server
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Cool things about Next.JS

A folder counts as a router... everything stays inside clean development.
